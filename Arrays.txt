- BigO complexity for arrays =>
    - access => O(1) for both static and dynamic arrays; mostly because of use of indexes
    - search => O(n) for both static and dynamic arrays
    - insertion => O(n) for dynamic arrays. Does not make sense for static arrays
    - appending => O(1) for dynamic arrays. Does not make sense for static arrays
    - deletion => O(n) for dynamic arrays. Does not make sense for static arrays
