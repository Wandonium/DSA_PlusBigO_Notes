- What is a Queue => it's a linear data structure that models real life queues with two primary operations enqueue and dequeue. It's a FIFO structure i.e we enqueue from the front of the queue and dequeue from the back of the queue.

- Uses of queues => 
    - Modeling real life queues e.g. managing seats in a Movie Theater app, managing orders in a Food Delivery app.
    - Web server request management where we need a FIFO queue for requests.
    - Breadth first search graph traversal.

- Time complexity for Queues => 
    - Enqueue: O(1)
    - Dequeue: O(1)
    - Peeking: O(1)
    - Contains: O(n)
    - Removal: O(n)
    - IsEmpty: O(1)
