- Stack is a LIFO (Last In First Out) structure.
- Uses of stacks =>
    - Undo mechanism in text editors
    - Compiler syntax checking when matching brackets and braces.
    - Used to support recursion by keeping track of previous function calls.
    - Used to do Depth First Search on a graph.

- BigO complexity for stacks =>
    - pushing: O(1)
    - popping: O(1)
    - peeking: O(1)
    - searching: O(n)
    - size: O(1)
