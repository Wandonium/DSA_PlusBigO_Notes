- BigO complexity for arrays =>
    - access => O(1) for both static and dynamic arrays; mostly because of use of indexes
    - search => O(n) for both static and dynamic arrays
    - insertion => O(n) for dynamic arrays. Does not make sense for static arrays
    - appending => O(1) for dynamic arrays. Does not make sense for static arrays
    - deletion => O(n) for dynamic arrays. Does not make sense for static arrays

- Dynamic array => array that grows and shrinks in size as needed i.e does not have a fixed length like a static array e.g ArrayList in Java, Vector in C++

- How to create a dynamic array using static arrays =>
    - Create a static array with an initial capacity
    - Add elements to the initial static array while keeping track of the capacity.
    - If adding a new element will exceed the capacity, create a new static array with double the capacity and copy all elements into the new static array.
