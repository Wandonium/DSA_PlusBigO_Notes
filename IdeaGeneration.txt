- Ways to generate ideas for a problem's solution during interviews =>
    - Simplify the task => solve a simpler version of the problem then see if that helps you find a solution to the original problem.
    - Try a few examples => see if you can notice a pattern while executing the examples which will give you an idea on how to solve the problem.
    - Think of a suitable data structure => if a data structure could be the solution to the problem then think of the ones you know. You might have to combine multiple data structures to solve the problem.
    - Think about related problems you know => Many problems are related and sometimes you can apply the same technique to multiple problems e.g the sliding window technique.
